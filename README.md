# QA Assessment: E-commerce Payment Flow Tests (Demo)

This repository is a demonstration project for a QA assessment focused on testing the payment flow of an e-commerce platform (inspired by Lazada/Amazon), including **automated tests** using **Selenium (Java with TestNG)** and **Cypress (JavaScript with Mock API support)**.

---

## Project Structure
Cypress
Test files for automated payment flow are located in
Cypress-paymentflow-with-mock-api-test/cypress/e2e/Payment/.

Mock API responses (like successful payment data) are stored in
Cypress-paymentflow-with-mock-api-test/cypress/fixtures/.

Selenium
For Selenium-based automation, Java Page Object classes are inside
selenium-paymentflow-tests/src/test/java/pages

Selenium TestNG test scripts are located in
selenium-paymentflow-tests/src/test/java/tests

### Automated Testing

#### ✅ Selenium (Java + TestNG)
- Follows Page Object Model (POM) structure.
- Tests payment flow including coupon application and confirmation.
- Uses TestNG as the test runner.

#### ✅ Cypress (JavaScript + Mock API)
- Simulates real user flow with mocked API responses.
- Making payment (success & failure)
- Uses `.json` fixtures to simulate backend behavior.

## How to Run Tests

### Cypress

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   Fixtures are located in cypress/fixtures/.

## 🚀 Selenium

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Java 8+
- Maven
- Google Chrome Browser

Notes
All API calls in Cypress tests are mocked using cy.intercept() and fixture files.

The application under test simulates a Lazada-like e-commerce flow, but is not connected to any real production systems.

Selenium tests are UI-level only and do not process real payments or call external payment gateways.
